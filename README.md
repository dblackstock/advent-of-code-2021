# Advent of Code 2021

This year I made an attempt at the coding challenges in 2021's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I used C# as this is a language used within my work team and I wanted to solidify my familiarity with it.
I also used the .NET 5 framework for the same reason.

## How to run

After installing C# and .NET, run the program with `dotnet run`.
The program runs entirely in the command line. You will be prompted to enter a day, which then runs the function I used to solve the chosen day.
