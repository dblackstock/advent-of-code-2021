# Advent of Code 2021

This year I made an attempt at the coding challenges in 2021's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I used C# as this is a language used within my work team and I wanted to solidify my familiarity with it.
I also used the .NET 5 framework for the same reason.

Each day of the challenge has two connected questions, so there was a benefit to me writing my code in a way that it could be easily tweaked as the second question was inevitably a twist or expansion on the first. Writing understandable code was useful for troubleshooting and following a logical train of thought. However there is a decent amount of duplication since after the second question was complete the classes and methods used were no longer needed. There was no benefit in writing code that could be pulled in to help with later questions, since the scope of these questions was unknown.

## How to run

After installing C# and .NET, run the program with `dotnet run`.
The program runs entirely in the command line. You will be prompted to enter a day, which then runs the function I used to solve the chosen day.
